<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Moulding Maize Starch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rapidly Digestible Starch</li><li>Slowly Digestible Starch</li><li>Resistant Starch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The moulding maize starch market encompasses three primary types based on digestion rates: rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS). RDS is quickly broken down and absorbed, providing immediate energy. SDS is digested more gradually, releasing energy over a longer period, beneficial for sustained energy and blood sugar control. RS, on the other hand, resists digestion in the small intestine, promoting gut health and enhancing satiety. Each type serves distinct applications in food and nutrition sectors.</p></p>
